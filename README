OpenAIM Ruby Library

Very basic. Only has Presence API for now. For more info on OpenAIM Presence API, check out http://dev.aol.com/aim/presence


Example:
require 'rubygems'
require 'openaim'

presence = OpenAIM::Presence.new('YOUR OPEN AIM API KEY')
user = presence.get('aim_username')
puts "User is #{user.status}"
